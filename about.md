I'm Andrew Mussey, a software developer at [Samba TV](https://samba.tv) in San Francisco, CA. I've been writing code for more than 10 years, focusing mainly on web technologies. My knowledge-base spans the full software stack, covering both front-end and back-end development.

I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2013 with a bachelor's in Computer Science.  After graduation, I joined the [Rackspace Cloud Control Panel](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) (Reach) team in Blacksburg, VA, focusing primarily on back-end development, infrastructure maintenance, and developer enablement.  I also served as the resident videographer for the Rackspace Blacksburg office.

During the fall of 2015, I relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area to work with [Fitnet](https://fit.net) and be a part of [OrangeFab Season 5](http://orangefab-1.hs-sites.com/blog/introducing-our-season-5-class).

On the side, I work as a freelance videographer for local startups, non-profits, and the standup comedy community. Notable clients include the coding group [Let's Code Blacksburg!](http://letscodeblacksburg.org/) and the [Smart Beginnings Reading Hour](http://www.smartbeginningsnrv.org/content/reading-hour). Previously, I worked with [Virginia Tech Television](http://www.vttv33.com/) producing the sketch comedy series [*The Sketch*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowl6PYoVZ0IXLIqHh9l-8UWUAqVQd9Z7).
