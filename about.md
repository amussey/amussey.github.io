I'm Andrew Mussey, a software developer at Rackspace in Blacksburg, VA. I've been writing code for more than 10 years, focusing mainly on web technologies. My knowledge-base spans the full software stack, covering both front-end and back-end development.

On the side, I work as a freelance videographer for local startups, non-profits, and the standup comedy community. Notable clients include the coding group [Let's Code Blacksburg!](http://letscodeblacksburg.org/) and the [Smart Beginnings Reading Hour](http://www.smartbeginningsnrv.org/content/reading-hour). Previously, I worked with [Virginia Tech Television](http://www.vttv33.com/) producing the sketch comedy series [*The Sketch*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowl6PYoVZ0IXLIqHh9l-8UWUAqVQd9Z7).

I'm a 2013 Virginia Tech graduate with a bachelor's in Computer Science.
